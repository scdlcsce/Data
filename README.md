# Data

This is the data for paper `` Scalable Clone Detection with LCS-oriented Code Embedding ''


in dir ./general_clone_detection, there are the testing data, as well as the precision and recall on the testing data for various clone detectors.

in dir ./cloned_bug_detection, there is the detection result of kernel-to-freebsd detection with threshold set to 0.35

in dir ./scalability_evaluation, there are the log for NIL in 100MLOC codebase detection, as well as the log for our method in 100MLOC/250MLOC detection.
